## Changelog

### 2026-07-16 (late)

- **deploy**: published to GitHub as public repo https://github.com/nxxxsooo/codex-minus
  - why: local-only repo; AGPL derivative is fine to publish openly
  - verified: push succeeded, repo visible as PUBLIC
  - refs: none
- **chore**: rewrote git history with git-filter-repo to drop node_modules / src-tauri/target / dist blobs committed before .gitignore existed
  - why: history carried 255MB of build artifacts; unacceptable clone size for a public repo. No remote/collaborators existed, so hash rewrite was free
  - verified: .git 255MB → 1.2MB, all 9 commits preserved; pre-rewrite backup at /tmp/codex-minus-git-backup
  - refs: none
- **chore**: added AGPL-3.0 LICENSE full text
  - why: Cargo.toml declared AGPL-3.0-only but license text was missing; required for public distribution of a derivative work
  - refs: LICENSE

### 2026-07-16

- **docs**: added AGENTS.md (constraints: pinned-rev upstream deps, context 保护罩, dead 57321 protocol path, toml_edit implicit-table gotcha) and this BOARD.md
  - why: project had no on-disk constraints/history; resume flow depended on memory only
  - verified: not applicable
  - refs: AGENTS.md, memory `codex-minus` (2026-07-15)
- **chore**: confirmed `src/presets.ts` is live code (imported via `components/ProviderPresetSelector.tsx`, used at App.tsx:2166) after a false dead-code diagnosis; restored from git untouched
  - why: initial grep missed the `../presets` import path; deletion would have broken the preset picker
  - verified: `tsc --noEmit` clean, worktree clean
  - refs: src/presets.ts, src/components/ProviderPresetSelector.tsx

### 2026-07-15

- **feat**: codex-minus built and installed as `/Applications/Codex-- Manager.app`, replacing Codex++ (Codex++.app deleted)
  - why: Codex++'s "工具与插件" (context) feature stored managed MCP copies and merged them back into config.toml on provider switch — a stale copy ate `[mcp_servers.memory]` transport on 2026-07-15 morning; feature removed wholesale in the fork
  - verified: real launch log shows `store_scrubbed` fired; 4 unit tests pin the context guard
  - refs: src-tauri/src/commands.rs (`with_context_tables_protected`), commits dba979c..5ee5db4
- **feat**: sessions screen — provider-sync repair restored (async), all IO-heavy commands moved off the main thread, session list rendering paginated
  - refs: commit 5ee5db4
- **feat**: ux — dual-mount screens (no remount jank), dropped about/settings pages (test-model field moved to relay screen), restored v1.2.35 green theme; per-route data loading parallelized
  - refs: commits 72c197f, 2d14c62
- **feat**: macOS app bundle target + icns icon; frontend trimmed 7122→5024 lines (relay/sessions/context/doctor screens only)
  - verified: tsc clean, vite + cargo build green
  - refs: commits 5453bd1, 6b78c56
